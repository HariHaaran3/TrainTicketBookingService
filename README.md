# üöÜ Train Ticket Booking Service

## üìù Introduction

This is a Spring Boot service for managing train ticket reservations and bookings.

```
This command will clean the existing compiled files, download and install the project's dependencies, and build the project.

### Queries to view the tables:

```sql
SELECT * FROM train_detail;
SELECT * FROM train_section_and_seat_detail;
SELECT * FROM user_detail;
SELECT * FROM ticket_booking_detail;
```


## üåê Endpoints

1. First, we need to create a user and then authenticate the user to generate a JWT token. This JWT token is valid for 5 minutes. We need to use this JWT token in the header to access all the endpoints. Steps 1 and 2 below are mandatory, after which you can use the other endpoints with the JWT token.

2. RateLimiter is implemented with limitForPeriod=3 requests per second, timeoutDuration=1s, and limitRefreshPeriod=1s.

## üìù Step 1: Create User
